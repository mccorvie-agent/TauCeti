# The ramified primes of a cyclotomic compositum

Let `K ⊆ L ⊆ M` be a tower of number fields. A prime of `K` ramifying in `L` ramifies in `M`: an
unramified prime of `𝓞 M` lies over an unramified prime of `𝓞 L`. When `M = L(μ_m)` is an `m`-th
cyclotomic extension of `L`, a partial converse holds: every prime of `K` that ramifies in `M` but
not in `L` divides `m`. Away from `m` the two ramified sets therefore agree.

This is the ramification half of the compositum step in the cyclotomic crossing for the
Chebotarev density theorem. The Frobenius compatibility of the compositum,
`NumberField.Chebotarev.mem_frobeniusPrimeSet_galEquivProd_symm_iff`, is stated for primes
unramified in `M` and prime to `m`; `notMem_ramifiedPrimes_iff_of_natCast_notMem` turns the first
hypothesis into unramifiedness in `L`, so the primes discarded on passing from `L` to `M` all lie
above `m` and form a finite set.

## Main results

* `NumberField.Chebotarev.mem_ramifiedPrimes_of_mem_ramifiedPrimes_of_natCast_notMem`: for
  `M = L(μ_m)`, a prime of `K` ramifying in `M` and not dividing `m` ramifies in `L`.
* `NumberField.Chebotarev.ramifiedPrimes_subset_ramifiedPrimes_union_natCast_mem`: the same
  statement as an inclusion of sets,
  `ramifiedPrimes K M ⊆ ramifiedPrimes K L ∪ {𝔭 | (m : 𝓞 K) ∈ 𝔭}`.
* `NumberField.Chebotarev.mem_ramifiedPrimes_iff_of_natCast_notMem` and
  `NumberField.Chebotarev.notMem_ramifiedPrimes_iff_of_natCast_notMem`: away from `m`, ramifying in
  `M` and ramifying in `L` are equivalent.

* `NumberField.Chebotarev.mem_ramifiedPrimes_of_natCast_mem`: over `ℚ`, a prime dividing the
  level ramifies, provided that a prime of norm two divides the level to at least the second power.
